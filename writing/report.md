#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

I used the "Interactive demo for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm" to perform my analysis.

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 This was the optimal alignment that I had using the software:

After optimal alignment the two sequences are fairly similar, and they recieved an overall score of 10 using the given parameters and algorithm.

 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 In my opinion, the two sequences are closely related. There are definitly some mismatches, however they show a relatively strong similarity when using this software.


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?


The proof I have is purely from the alignment and algorithm shown above. No having any other way to further examine the sequence, I must go off of the fact that they have a relatively strong overall score indicative of similarity. More data and sequencing could be used to be more accurate in this analysis.




#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?


Chicken vs avian is 96% similar

Chicken vs human is 95.2% similar

Human vs. avian is 97.5% similar


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?


For these particular strains, the similarity between strains is more indicative of time than it is of species, as you would normally expect avian and chicken strains to be the most similar as compared to human. This is not the case in this situation however as the avian and human sequences are the most similar, while also being the most recently collected. My knowledge in this field is limited, and I may be missing the mark, but I would be more concerned if the human variation was considerably different than the other two. The virus does seem to be mutating overtime, but not in a particularly human targeted way. Other data that could provide more context would be the study of the differing protein sequences, that may lend to the virus being capable of binding to the sialic acid receptors that would make humans more at risk (as mentioned in the lab sheet). 

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?
