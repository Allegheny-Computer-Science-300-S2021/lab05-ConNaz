#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

I used the "Interactive demo for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm" to perform my analysis.

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 This was the optimal alignment that I had using the software:

After optimal alignment the two sequences are fairly similar, and they recieved an overall score of 10 using the given parameters and algorithm.

 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 In my opinion, the two sequences are closely related. There are definitly some mismatches, however they show a relatively strong similarity when using this software.


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?


The proof I have is purely from the alignment and algorithm shown above. No having any other way to further examine the sequence, I must go off of the fact that they have a relatively strong overall score indicative of similarity. More data and sequencing could be used to be more accurate in this analysis.




#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

#TODO


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?


#TODO

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?


#TODO
